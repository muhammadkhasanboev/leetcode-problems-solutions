//The first and the easiest problem:
/*
Given an array of integers nums[] and an integer target,
return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution,
and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

        for(int i=0; i<=nums.length-1; i++){
            for(int j=i+1; j<=nums.length-1; j++){
                if(nums[i]+nums[j]==target){
                    arr[0] = i;
                    arr[1] = j;
                    break;
                }

        }
        return arr;

    //how to test
    public static void main(String[] args){
        TwoSum test = new TwoSum();
        int arr[] = {2,7,11,15};
        int target = 9;

        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(test.twoSum(arr, target)));
    }
}

/*
Explanation:
This is brute-force solution, so it is bad at timing.

- we are given array of integers, so we should add them up one by one,
  so I used nested for loop.

- How nested for loop is working here:
    in the first loop it takes i value as 0 and j value as i+1 = 1
    and it is equal to nums[0] = 2 and nums[1] = 7 in the first iteration.

- after that if statement checks the sum with that indexes, now it is matching
  with target so it breaks the loop and returns indexes
